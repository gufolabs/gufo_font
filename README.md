## On Gufo Stack

This product is a part of [Gufo Stack][Gufo Stack] - the collaborative effort 
led by [Gufo Labs][Gufo Labs]. Our goal is to create a robust and flexible 
set of tools to create network management software and automate 
routine administration tasks.

To do this, we extract the key technologies that have proven themselves 
in the [NOC][NOC] and bring them as separate packages. Then we work on API,
performance tuning, documentation, and testing. The [NOC][NOC] uses the final result
as the external dependencies.

[Gufo Stack][Gufo Stack] makes the [NOC][NOC] better, and this is our primary task. But other products
can benefit from [Gufo Stack][Gufo Stack] too. So we believe that our effort will make 
the other network management products better.
