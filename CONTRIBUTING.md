# Contributing to Gufo Font

Looking to contribute something to Gufo Font? **Here's how you can help.**

## Quick start

We only accept issues bug reports or feature requests.
Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within the Gufo Font core.

## Icon Requests

Please do not submit icon requests as issues. Instead, please use Github's Discussions:

* [Request a new icon](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/discussions/new?category=icon-requests)

## Key branches

- `master` is the latest, deployed version

## Pull requests

- At the moment we are not accepting pull requests containing icons
- The files in this repository are generated elsewhere and we do not merge PR's directly into master
- Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes–keep them simple and small
- Try to share which browsers your code has been tested in before submitting a pull request
